- each sample has two channels 
- so the two have to go together making it 4 bytes per that we need to reverse 
- EX: [04 05 | 0e 57]  <- this is one "sample". each is a different channel (so two microphones)
- Left and right channel need to stay together

- TRY THESE THINGS?
    - interpret original byte arr as int* instead of short*
    - the computer now looks at byte_array as chunks of 4 bytes
    - do the reversing
    - interpret new byte arr as char* and write to file
